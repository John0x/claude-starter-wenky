# Feature: Kitesurfing Spots Map Application

## Overview
Create a simple web application that displays kitesurfing spots on an interactive map using mock data. The first iteration will focus on basic functionality with a clean, responsive interface using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and a modern map library.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Interactive map displays with proper controls and navigation
- [ ] At least 5 mock kitesurfing spots are visible on the map with custom markers
- [ ] Clicking a spot shows detailed information in a popup or sidebar
- [ ] Application is responsive and works well on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Clean, modern UI following the project's design system

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Map Integration

#### Task 1.1: Set Up Map Component Structure
**Status:** ‚¨ú Not Started
**Description:** Create a new page for the map application and set up the basic component structure with proper TypeScript types. Choose and integrate a suitable map library (Leaflet or Mapbox GL JS).
**Implementation Notes:**
```
[Empty - will be filled during implementation]
```
**Validation:** Follow project validation strategy after completing this task

#### Task 1.2: Integrate Map Library and Basic Map Display
**Status:** ‚¨ú Not Started
**Description:** Implement the map component with proper initialization, center it on a coastal area suitable for kitesurfing, and ensure it renders correctly with basic controls.
**Implementation Notes:**
```
[Empty - will be filled during implementation]
```
**Validation:** Follow project validation strategy after completing this task

### Phase 2: Data Structure and Mock Data

#### Task 2.1: Define TypeScript Types and Mock Data
**Status:** ‚¨ú Not Started
**Description:** Create TypeScript interfaces for kitesurfing spot data including name, coordinates, wind conditions, difficulty level, and description. Create at least 5 diverse mock spots in different coastal locations.
**Implementation Notes:**
```
[Empty - will be filled during implementation]
```
**Validation:** Follow project validation strategy after completing this task

#### Task 2.2: Display Spot Markers on Map
**Status:** ‚¨ú Not Started
**Description:** Add custom markers for each kitesurfing spot on the map with appropriate icons and styling that fits the overall design system.
**Implementation Notes:**
```
[Empty - will be filled during implementation]
```
**Validation:** Follow project validation strategy after completing this task

### Phase 3: Interactive Features and UI

#### Task 3.1: Implement Spot Information Display
**Status:** ‚¨ú Not Started
**Description:** Create a popup or sidebar component that shows detailed spot information when clicking on a marker. Include spot name, wind conditions, difficulty level, and description.
**Implementation Notes:**
```
[Empty - will be filled during implementation]
```
**Validation:** Follow project validation strategy after completing this task

#### Task 3.2: Add Responsive Design and Mobile Optimization
**Status:** ‚¨ú Not Started
**Description:** Ensure the map and all interactive elements work well on mobile devices with proper touch controls and responsive layout using Tailwind CSS.
**Implementation Notes:**
```
[Empty - will be filled during implementation]
```
**Validation:** Follow project validation strategy after completing this task

#### Task 3.3: Add Navigation and Basic UI Components
**Status:** ‚¨ú Not Started
**Description:** Create a clean navigation structure, add a title/header, and implement any additional UI components needed for a polished user experience using shadcn/ui components.
**Implementation Notes:**
```
[Empty - will be filled during implementation]
```
**Validation:** Follow project validation strategy after completing this task

### Phase 4: Testing and Polish

#### Task 4.1: Write End-to-End Tests
**Status:** ‚¨ú Not Started
**Description:** Create Playwright tests that verify map loading, marker display, spot information popups, and basic user interactions.
**Implementation Notes:**
```
[Empty - will be filled during implementation]
```
**Validation:** Follow project validation strategy after completing this task

#### Task 4.2: Final Polish and Performance Optimization
**Status:** ‚¨ú Not Started
**Description:** Review the application for any performance issues, ensure smooth animations, and add any final styling touches for a professional appearance.
**Implementation Notes:**
```
[Empty - will be filled during implementation]
```
**Validation:** Follow project validation strategy after completing this task

## Validation Strategy
**ALWAYS** work iteratively and validate your work after finishing each task by following these steps in order:

### Quick Validation Steps (run for each task)
1. **Linting**: `npm run lint` - Check for syntax and style issues
2. **Specific tests**: Run only relevant Playwright tests for changed functionality
3. **Type checking**: `npm run typecheck` - Ensure TypeScript correctness

### Complete Validation (run only after all tasks are complete)
4. **Build**: `npm run build` - Full production build verification
5. **Complete test suite**: `npm run test` - All Playwright end-to-end tests

### Testing Guidelines
- **ALWAYS** write tests for new functionality - this is required for validation
- Write realistic e2e tests from a user perspective focusing on actual interactions
- **NEVER** write trivial tests that only assert component visibility
- Focus on meaningful user workflows and business logic
- If existing tests fail that are not part of the current task, **STOP** and ask for guidance
- Do NOT auto-fix unrelated test failures

## Current State Summary
**Current Task:** None - plan created
**Next Task:** Task 1.1
**Blockers:** None

## Handoff Notes
**Last Session Summary:**
- Plan created, awaiting implementation start
- Environment requirements: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Known considerations: Choose between Leaflet and Mapbox GL JS for map implementation

**Resume Instructions:**
1. Review this plan
2. Begin with Task 1.1 or resume from Current Task
3. Follow the validation strategy after each task
