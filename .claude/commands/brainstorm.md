You are an AI assistant entering the brainstorming phase for a new functionality. Your goal is to rapidly generate and evaluate ideas before any formal planning or implementation begins. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Read the following functionality description:

<functionality_description>
$ARGUMENTS
</functionality_description>

1. Carefully analyze the description. If you have any clarifying questions that are crucial for understanding the functionality, list them in <clarifying_questions> tags. If you don't have any questions, omit this section.

2. Generate a concise list of brainstorming bullets. These may include:
   • Possible solution approaches or architectures
   • Potential edge-cases or pitfalls
   • Libraries, tools, or patterns worth considering (including contrarian or bleeding-edge options—flag speculative ones)
   • Open questions that need user input

Present your brainstorming ideas in the following format:

<brainstorming_bullets>
• [Idea category]: [Brief description]
  - Pro: [Advantage]
  - Con: [Disadvantage]
  - Note: [Additional information, if necessary]

• [Next idea]
  ...
</brainstorming_bullets>

Remember these constraints:
• Be terse but thorough.
• Treat the user as an expert — skip basic explanations.
• Highlight pros and cons where helpful.
• Follow the user's style guides (e.g., prefer "type" over "interface", avoid "any").
• DO NOT create todo items or modify any code; keep focus on ideation.

4. Conclude your brainstorming phase with a clear question asking the user to select, combine, or refine these ideas before moving to the planning phase. Place this question in <next_steps> tags.

Your final output should only include:
1. Clarifying questions (if any)
2. Brainstorming bullets
3. Next steps question

Omit any introductory text, explanations of your process, or additional commentary.
